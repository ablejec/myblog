I was missing the tag and category cloud in the blog layout I started to use. With a little help I managed to set the 
tag and categorues clouds that are nicely sitting on the right hand side of the page. The clouds are fixed and will not disappear if one scrolls down along the list of posts.

Good sources to learn how to are on [w3 schools](http://www.w3schools.com/). Specific useful hint I used:
[Fixed floating aside on the right](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15565754/fixed-floating-aside-on-the-right).
